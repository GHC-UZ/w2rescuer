A shallow water code for 1D computations
It is a Finite Volume code of (up to) third order in space and 
(up to) fourth order in time. It uses the approximate Riemann solver of Roe (Roe,1981)
and an upwinding of the topography source term (Bermudez et al, 1984). For the spacial accuracy 
a third order MUSCL-type scheme is used. To satisfy the C-property to higher spatial order an extra term to bed is added (Hubbard and Garcia-Navvaro,2000) and for the extended C-property we do a redefinition of the bed slope and the numerical fluxes are computed assuming temporarily zero velocity at wet/dry fronts. Four time schemes have been implemented, euler, RK3, EBDF3 and adams moulton-adams basforth

The initial conditions of the problems are in initial_cond.f90 and the topography in initial_bed.f90
my_solver uses the files input.dat and gauges.dat. The input.dat contains all the numerical parameters of the test case.
gauges.dat contains the wave gauges.dat where the time series of the surface elevation is recorded.


The source is in the folder src. The input files are placed in the folder input and the output files are placed in the folder output
