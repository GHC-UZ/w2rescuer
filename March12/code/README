A shallow water code for 1D computations (toy code)
It is a Finite Volume code first order in space and in time. It uses the approximate Riemann solver of Roe (Roe,1981)
and an upwinding of the topography source term (Bermudez et al, 1984). It has the option for other solvers too without the topography. 

The initial conditions of the problems are in initial_cond.f90 and the topography in initial_bed.f90
my_1dsolver uses the files input.dat and gauges.dat. The input.dat contains all the numerical parameters of the test case.
gauges.dat contains the wave gauges.dat where the time series of the surface elevation is recorded.


The source is in the folder src. The input files are placed in the folder input and the output files are placed in the folder output
