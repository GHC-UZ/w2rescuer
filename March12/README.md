For the workshop on March 12-13, you will need the following in your Linux environment:

Fortran Compiler: Please install Fortran 10.2.1-5, which is required to compile the code I will provide for the first two days. The code will be available in the repository on March 12.

Matlab or Octave: You will need Matlab or Octave to visualize your results.

For the third day, when working with the 2D SLOWS code, you will also need:

CMake: Ensure that the CMake build system is installed.
Visualization Tools: You will need Tecplot or ParaView to visualize the results.
You can find SLOWS here: https://gitlab.inria.fr/slows-public-group/slows_public.
Please try to clone and install it before the workshop. If you can not we will do it together.

Repository containing the codes and the slides for the W2 RESCUER meeting

It is organized by days and contains overall:

- 1D SW code
- 1D SW + Exner code
- 2D SW code
- 1D High order SW code
- 1D SW code with porosity
- Toy code to practice with GPU memory structure, sintaxis and kernels 
- 2D-GPU SW code (extension of the previous code to GPU)

Additionally you will find the slides and (if any) the additional material used in each masterclass.
